# Natural_Language_Processing_Projects

**Named_Entity_Tagging**: is an assignment project I did for my NLP course. The project involved applying a named entity recognition (NER) task to the . The code for the model is a modified version of the model found from one of pytorch's tutorials: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nlp/advanced_tutorial.html which uses a bi-LSTM combined with a Conditional Random Field to solve the NER task. The code was edited to include a self-attention mechanism and extract additional word features. 

**IMDB_Reviews_Sentiment_Analysis**: contains an LSTM models that uses pre-trained word and character embeddings to perform a sentiment classification task on IMDB reviews attained from Kaggle. The model outputs whether the review has a positive or negative sentiment.
