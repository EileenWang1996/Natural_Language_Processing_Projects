        "Firstly, for the pre-processing method, it was found that some of the reviews contained html tags in the form of $<br />$. These were all replaced with empty strings as they serve no purpose to the sentiment classification problem. Secondly, all punctuation and anything that was not a word was filtered out from the dataset as I believe they will just add noise to the training process. While numbers might be useful in evaluating whether a review is positive or not (e.g. a person might say something along the lines of: 'I rate this film a 10 out of 10!'), it was found that at most times, the numbers were used to quote the length of the movie, a year, someone's age, part of the movie title or other aspects that are not useful for sentiment analysis (see output below). Although, there were still some cases where numbers were used to rate a film, I decided to only keep alpha characters (after converting all characters to lowercase) to simplify the vocabulary size and also to not risk adding noise to the dataset. Finally, it was decided to use a Porter stemmer over lemmatising. Although lemmatising has the ability to keep the resulting output as a word that can be found in a dictionary, I found that lemmatising will lemmatise both the words 'enjoy' and 'enjoyable' to themselves. However, stemming will stem both 'enjoy' and 'enjoyable' to 'enjoy', thus treating the 2 words as essentially the same (which is desirable, considering that both words have the same meaning but are just of different form). Finally, lemmatisation also cannot handle unknown words. In the case of this dataset, internet slang is used alot and it would be a good idea to keep them through stemming. Any contractions and english stop-words were also removed from the training and test set because these words won't help us to find the context of the review and also helps in reducing vocabulary size."

The reasons remain the same as stated above. Additionally, some extra pre-processing and filtering was done to create the vocabulary list. Firstly, rare words that occured less than 5 times in both the training and test set were removed. The reason for this was because I believe that words that rarely occur (such as movie titles, actor names, complex words that people often don't use, technical terms/jargon or perhaps even spelling errors) are most likely not useful for the sentiment classification process and would just create redundant noise in the model's learning process. Moreover, this also helps reduce the vocabulary size which makes training the word embedding model faster. Secondly, reviews were truncated to be at most 200 words long. This was done because it was found that approximately 87% of the reviews were less than 200 in length (see histogram below) and the maximum review length was over 1000 words long. Although cutting down reviews could result in information loss, if no truncation was done, then for the sequence model, I would have to pad all reviews to be approximately 1000 of length. However, too much padding is not ideal as this could lead to sparse sequences which may waste memory and also the longer sequences can cause slower training due to having to backpropagate over the entire sequence.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore, a skipgram model was chosen for the word embedding model implementation. Although skip-gram models take longer to train than CBOW, they have been shown to work well when predicting rare words since it tries to predict the context word given the centre word. Given that there are a lot of words in the total reviews that are not used alot (e.g. there are a lot of words appearing 10 or 20 times out of the 50,000 reviews), I thought a skip-gram model would work better. Also, since the vocabulary size is not that big (approx. 25,000) after filtering,  training this type of model will not be that computationally inefficient. \n",
        "\n",
        "For the skipgram creations, a window size of 2 was used. I decided to use a small window size because as mentioned before, I did a lot of prior word filtering (especially since I filtered out 46,490 infrequently used words). Thus, even though the window size is 2, the range covered by this window size is actually alot larger because I may have taken out a lot of words from each sentence in each review. For that same reason, I avoided a larger window size of 3 or 4 as I believe that this will be too large, resulting in word-pairs where the centre word is not related to the specified context word. \n"

        "For the pre-processing methods used in the character embedding model, I decided to keep the same pre-processed train and test reviews as used to train the word embedding model. The reason for this is that the vocabulary from the word embedding model should be the same vocabulary as the one used in the character embedding model as we are trying to find a character-based embedding for each word embedding that was pre-trained in section 2.1. Thus, if any different pre-processing technique was used (such as lemmatising instead of stemming), this might change the vocabulary.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, additional pre-processing had to be performed before the character-embedding model could be implemented. Firstly, it was necessary to pad all the words in the vocabulary to be of the same size as all sequences fed into a neural sequence network must be of the same length. I found that the longest word in the vocabulary list was 72 characters long. However, the rest of the words were less than or equal to 16 characters. Thus, I decided to pad each word to 16 in length and truncate the word that was 72 characters long as padding all sequences to 72 in length would be a waste of memory, considering that we need to use one-hot encoding later. \n",
        "\n",
        "A look-up table was also created which was implemented as a python 'dictionary' where the key is the word and the value is the corresponding pre-trained word embedding obtained from section 2.1. This was done so that the word embedding for a word could be easily obtained during the training process of the character embedding model when we need to compare the loss between the character-based word embedding and the pre-trained word embedding vector.

        "To create the character embedding model, I decided to use a Cosine-Embedding loss function to compare the character-based word embedding with the pre-trained word embedding from the skipgram model. To do this, the output of the bi-LSTM has to be of the same size as the pre-trained word embeddings which were vectors of size 100. For this reason, the number of hidden units was decided to be 50. This is because after concatenating the last hidden states from the forward and backward pass in the bi-LSTM model, the resulting output would be a vector of size 100 which is the desired output size. It is noted that bi-LSTM was chosen as the model because such architectures have been shown to usually learn faster than the one-directional approach, especially for natural language processing tasks. Moreover, an RNN was avoided as they tend to not do well and experience vanishing gradients when dealing with long sequences."

        "Looking at the confusion matrix, we can see that precision and recall for both classes are ranging from approximately 80-90%. The high precision and recall indicates that the model has high true positives and negatives and low false positives and false negatives. Given that precision is over 90% while recall is 79.35% for the negative class, we can also infer that false negatives for this class tend to be higher while false positives are lower. The reverse is true for the positive class. As recall is above 90% and precision is lower at 81.72%, the model seems to have more trouble in minimising false positives compared to false negatives. Nevertheless, the weighted F1-scores and accuracy are high (over 85%) which indicates that the model performs quite well on the test set in addition to the training set.\n",
